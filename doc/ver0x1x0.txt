HwSim6809 Hardare Simulator for MC6809 Systems
version 0.1.0 - 01/15/2013 - Krista Hill - kmhill@hartford.edu
=========
This is a development version, the status is as follows:

o The simulator exists as a compiled library and two Lua files.
  Development thus far has been on Lubuntu Linux, with gcc and Lua 5.1
o No build tools yet, the comments at the top of each module give
  some idea of how to build the compiled library
o No configuration files, details are in the Lua scripts
o Can configure a memory system with RAM, ROM
o No peripherals yet exist, not able to attach any peripberals yet
o Can read an s19 file into a memory system
o Can execute instructions, much of the instruction set is complete,
  missing the long branches and branch to subroutine instructions.
  Only software interrupts and reset are implemented
o CmdFile.lua provides a simple interactive command line interface

There is much to do, but primarily, testing is needed.  I've only run
a very small number of example programs
